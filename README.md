Pong 2
Brandt Rosentreter (bjbrose)

For my game, I implmented a different, updated version of the classic game Pong. 
In this game, There are 4 walls instead of 2 walls, with 4 different paddles. 
The game is meant to be played by one person. The paddles are currently controlled 
by the j,k,i, and l keys due to the fact that I had no android device to test the 
game on and only an emulator. In theory, the paddles would be controlled by the 
finger sliding up/down and left/right.

To play the game, the player controls every paddle by moving left/right with the 
j/l keys respectively, and up/down with the i/k keys respectively. If the ball 
hits one of the paddles, it is kept in play like normal Pong, and if it doesn't, 
the ball refreshes in the middle.

To download and play the game, download the Pong 2 directory from 
https://github.com/BRosentreter/481_homework2 and run it on your computer, 
I used Eclipse and a Nexus One emulator.
